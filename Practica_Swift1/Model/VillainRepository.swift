He takes pleasure in the suffering of others, enjoying the agonized expressions they make as he tortures them. This sadism even extends to his fellow Demons, as he relishes seeing his fellow Lower Ranks being killed right in front of his eyes. "),

He sees no value in any humans he has encountered and shows little value in his own subordinates. Rarely ever visually upset or happy, he appears completely monotone and detached on most occasions, even when he callously murders his own subordinates."),

To him, who do not perform their roles as he expects them to (namely to protect Rui unconditionally or follow his instructions) are worthless and as good as dead. ")]
